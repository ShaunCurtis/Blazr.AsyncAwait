# The Async Series

The Async Series is a collection of documents and notes describing many of the important features of asynchronous behaviour.

Start with the [Introduction](./Introduction.md) which provides an overview and some important notes.

Move on to [The Async State Machine](./The-Async-State-Machine/md), a concept without which `Async/Await` would not be possible.
